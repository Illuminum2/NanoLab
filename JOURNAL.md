Total hours so far: 4.5
- [x] I have a 3D printer

## Idea
A small and thus hopefully portable 3D printer that allows printing high quality models with a whole bunch of different materials, including ABS and ASA

## Design
###  Goals
- Cost(lower than ~300€ grant + Own Parts)
- Quality(Best quality achievable within the budget)
- Sacrifice speed for points above

### Build Volume
- 100(length)x100(width)x100-150(height) mm

### Printable materials
- PLA
- PETG
- TPU
- ABS
- ASA

### Printer size
- To be determined, as small as possible
- Electronics contained in chassis, only exception can be PSU

### Chassis
- Clear(gray) aluminum extrusion
- Sizes to be determined
- Blind joints
- Optionally angle brackets as well(if budget allows, probably unnecessary)
- Electronics and print head at bottom, print bed above, upside down printing
- Tinted translucent plastic cover(resin cast/print)
- Printed bottom cover

### Motion platform
- CoreXY system
- Dual linear rail y-axis mounted on extrusion
- Mono linear rail x-axis mounted on y-axis linear rails, maybe aluminum extrusion support, but better would be CF plate reinforcement
- Dual or mono linear rail z-axis on one extrusion(bed only mounted on one side)
- 3d printed belt housing mounted on extrusion and linear rails
- AB drives mounted on backside of aluminum square, gear ratio to be determined
- Fiberglass core GT2 belts for XY mechanism, routed in extrusion if possible
- Fiberglass or steel core GT2 belts for z-axis

## Day 1 (Mar 14)
I did general research, found a lot of useful guides and videos, and outlined the basic design idea. I also made a few sketches in my notebook to get a better idea of how everything should come together.
